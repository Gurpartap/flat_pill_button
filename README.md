===== Flat Pill Button

Inspired from the simple buttons in the [Letterpress](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8) iOS game, this RubyMotion project provides a subclass of UIButton for similar effect.

This project is also inspired from and is almost a direct port of @brianmichel's [FlatPillButton](https://github.com/brianmichel/FlatPillButton) Objective-C variant. Thanks Brian!
